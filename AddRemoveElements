<h1> Kat needs the drinks! </h1> 
<p>An unordered list:</p>
<div id="list"> 
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Juice</li>
  <li>Beer</li> 
  <li>Wine</li> 
</ul>
</div>

<button onclick="answer()"> Kat's Favorite </button> 
<br> 
<div id="div1"><p> </p> </div> 

<p id="vanish"> These are the kinds of things Kat will drink. Notice, Kool-aid isn't on there. That's because Kat isn't a conspiracy theorist and won't be drinking anyone's propaganda. </p> 

<p id="vanish"> "But that's not possible!" you might think. "Everyone is influenced/exposed to/believes SOME propaganda!" <b> True.</b> However, Kat avoids this by simply, NOT KNOWING ANYTHING!</p> 

<p id="vanish"> Is global warming a thing? Kat doesn't know what global warming is. Is the lockdown from Covid-19 legit, prolonging the inevetable, or a hoax? KAT DOESN'T CARE, AS LONG AS SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK!</p> 

<p id="vanish"> Genius, huh? </p>
